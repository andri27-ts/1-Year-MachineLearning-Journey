# 1 Year Machine Learning Journey 

### An advanced program in Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This is the program I followed in the last year to learn **Machine Learning**, especially **Deep Learning** and gain an in-depth knowledge in each and every of the most common AI fields, namely **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. All the material is taught by top world experts and researchers.

I hope that it'll be of any help to those of you who want to have a full and in-depth overview of these amazing field.

NB: all the lectures are free except for the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng but that I highly recommend.

To get a full overview of each 'chapter' and test my skills, I did a project that required a few months of work. They have been extremely important to get the hands dirty on each subject and to develop the skills required in the ML projects.
I highly advise you to do the same.
